# DP-070-Migrate-Open-Source-Workloads-to-Azure

The following is a summary of the lab objectives for each module:

## Lab 1: Introduction to open source database migration on Azure

There is no lab for this module

## Lab 2: Migrate an on-premises MySQL database to Azure

In this lab, you'll use the information learned in this module to migrate a MySQL database to Azure. To give complete coverage, students will perform two migrations. The first is an offline migration, transferring an on-premises MySQL database to a virtual machine running on Azure. The second is an online migration of the database running on the virtual machine to Azure Database for MySQL.

You'll also reconfigure and run a sample application that uses the database, to verify that the database operates correctly after each migration.

## Lab 3: Migrate an on-premises PostgreSQL database to Azure

In this lab, you'll use the information learned in this module to migrate a PostgreSQL database to Azure. To give complete coverage, students will perform two migrations. The first is an offline migration, transferring an on-premises PostgreSQL database to a virtual machine running on Azure. The second is an online migration of the database running on the virtual machine to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

You'll also reconfigure and run a sample application that uses the database, to verify that the database operates correctly after each migration.

## Lab 4: Monitoring and tuning a migrated database

In this lab, you'll use the information learned in this module to monitor and tune a database that they previously migrated. You will run a sample application that subjects the database to a read-heavy workload, and monitor the results using the metrics available in Azure. You will use Query Store to examine the performance of queries. You will then configure read replicas, and offload the read processing for some clients to the replicas. You will then examine how this change has affected performance.
